# Project #1:  Make an Android Application!

### Overview

- Congratulations on completing the first phase of the course! To reinforce your learning from the Kotlin Essentials and Android Essentials courses, it’s time for you to build an application of your own design.



**You will be working individually for this project**, but we are here to support you and you are here to support each other. Show us what you've got!

---

## What You've Learned

By the time you submit this project, you will have covered new ground in, and reviewed, many of the big themes of the course so far:

- **Command Line**: Practice interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.
- **Source Control**: Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.
- **Programming Fundamentals**: Work with objects, arrays, events, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.
- **Kotlin Fundamentals**: Learned how to declare variables, write function, use class and objects to obtain the desired results. 
- **Android Fundamentals**: Learned how to create an android application and how to implements the logic in it with layouts. 
- **Fragments**: Learned how to create multiple fragment and navigation between them. 
- **RecyclerView**: Learned how to iterate over the lists with RecyclerView. 
- **Room Database**: Learned how to store your data and retrieve it whenever it is required. 
- **Products and Teams**: Document your code and your code repository so others understand what you've built.

## Big Goals

- **Build a android application from scratch**, without a starter codebase
- Use your programming skills to **work out the logic for an application**
- **Separate activities** in your application
- Build an application **to a specification that someone else gives you**
- **Build a dynamic application that are production ready**
- **Create a `README.md` file that explains your app** to the world

## Technical Requirements
### To Do Application
Your **To Do Application** must display tasks in a list:

- - The task’s title
- - An indication of whether the task is completed or not
- - The task’s due date, if one has been provided by the user
- - If the task is past due, an indication of this fact should be shown to the user. And If the user taps on the cell, they should see a screen for editing additional task details, including:
- - - The creation date
- - - All of the information listed above
- - Also include the extended description where the user can provide more details about the task

- **The user must be able to add, delete and edit tasks. The data for the to do list must be persistent. No
data should be lost if the user terminates and relaunches the application, or if the user reboots their
device.**

- Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
- Have well-formatted, and well-commented code

## Potential Extra 

You are encouraged to use your imagination to make this application as nice and complete as you
wish. Below are some ideas to guide you, but you are not restricted to them:

- **Data persistence** You can get extra credit if you use Room for data persis.tence.
- **Sorting and filtering of tasks** Enable sorting of tasks alphabetically, by due date, by creation date,
etc.
- **Enable filtering**. You may want to filter tasks by categories such as Done, Not Done, Due Tomorrow,
etc. Also, you may want to assign custom tags to tasks, such as “Groceries”, “Home”, “Work”. Then
you can filter by tag(s). The tags are totally custom and the user can create as many as necessary. A
task can have more that on tag assigned.
- **Enforce due dates** When the due date for a task approaches, let the user know even if the app is not
currently in the foreground using a notification.
- **Geofencing** You have not yet learned in this course how to display maps or or find the user’s location.
Learn how to link a task to a location on the map, such as a grocery store. Then if you happen to be
within a certain distance from that location, the app can notify the user to take care of a task
associated with that location, such as buying milk at the grocery store. The user should get a
notification whether the application is in the foreground or not.



## README 

- List technologies used
- Link to wireframes and user stories.
- Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
- List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
- Describe how some of your favorite functions work

## Necessary Deliverables
* Projects are due Thursday, 04 Nov 2021 at 8:30am!

- A **working application, built by you**
- A **git repository hosted on Github**, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning of the project_

- **A `README.md` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, any other useful information etc.

- **Projects will be submitted by [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u5SSvcKwTl_Vsb3FV8ZqV2s2vAurv46s/edit#gid=1319027169)**

- A **5 minute presentation** in which you answer the following questions:
  - What is the application about and its features?
  - Is there any information you think might help us understand what you built?
  - What features did you include?
    - Make sure to explain anything "new" (things that we didn't cover in class)
  - What was the most difficult part of the project?
  - What was your favourite part to work on?
  - What would you like to add next?
  - Demo of the application

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, styling, activites) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
- **Use your Developer Tools** (`console logs`, inspector/ debugger, etc) to debug and solve problems
- Work everyday, **ask questions and come to office hours** when you need to. Think about adding relevant code to your application each day, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Check out Tutorial and Documentation resources** at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
- **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (View Groups and Views, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the application is over but you haven’t developed the whole application logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

1.  Create a repository on github for your project
2.  Clone it to the projects folder on your computer
3.  Add ViewGroups and Views for your application
4.  Connect your layout with activity to check that they all work correctly
5.  Build the most basic version of your application (very little styling, just a first version)
6.  Write the pseudocode for application logic as comments in your Kotlin file
7.  Begin working on the [user stories], 1 at a time
